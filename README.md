My starting point in shifting from English Language Teaching to Data Analytics.
Or maybe just broadening my ELT career...
But haw can one combine ELT with DA?
Actually, I love data. I love Logic, Statistics and Maths. Well, maybe rather from philosophical than practical point of view...
I also love Teaching. I'm inspired by challenges it gives me. Inspired by methodology and psychology in its base. Inspired by students.
But I hate seeing some (oh, I hope there're just a few of that sort in this world) other teachers being bitchy, tunnel-visioned and blind to the needs of their students, often intolerant, even ignorant. It's OK for me when they deal with young adults and adults. But when they deal with kids and teens I simply can't stand. 
The Russian public schools (as I mostly concerned about those) are sometimes bad. Simply awfully bad. 
And my hypothesis is that it's not about the system - it's about people. Wrong people whose choice to go into teaching was simply wrong. And they were never stopped and filtered. 
Hm, is this a system error here? My hypothesis is wrong? Well, that's the point to contemplate.
What if I apply some Data Analytics to the problem of wrong people in the Russian education? To possibly see where the problem lies. Can it be seen through DA?
I don't know yet, but I assume yes. Isn't it yet another hypothesis that DA can highlight the real problems in the Russian educational system?
The problem looks so delicate, so psychological, so intangible that I really doubt whether I can catch it with some data, sampling, analysis and so on.
But I want to try. Because... I can't solve the fuckin problem being just a teacher. Because principles and their deputies have power.
Someday I want to start my own school. And I probably need some data to succeed. Do I?

In my ideal DA social media presence I'd like to develop in Kaggle, Github, with many interesting DA projects where various members contribute to help develop my skills and drive great and insightful project together.
But first I need ideas to start with. I need to search a lot through Kaggle and Github for inspiration and experience. Then I'll start with my first projects. Most probably it will be related to Russian education, but still I don't know where to start because I'm not even sure how data can help promote best teaching practices to our schools! But al least this is kind of a goal
