Record DA ideas here.

1. Finding and analyzing some courses about anything - from music to data analytics.
This may be a blog where I gather and analyze something which can be tricky to choose from for different users.
Example:
I gather info about all DA courses available - free (e.g. stepik), payable (e.g. skillbox), 'semi-payable' (e.g. coursera), university degrees and others (if any).
Then I do analysis for them, compare them, visualize the results.
Then I pubpublish & advertize my blog
Thus, I create my portoflio + personal blog (+ some monetization possibly)
